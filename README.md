<h3 align="center">Passionate about technology in UberlÃ¢ndia-MG</h3>

- I am a passionate and dedicated computer science major, in the 6th semester of my degree, with a strong focus on back-end development and information security. Currently, I am honing my skills at the Junior Enterprise of the Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia (UFU) where I serve as a Project Director. My experience encompasses both back-end and front-end technologies, with a particular emphasis on Python and React.

- My role has allowed me to lead a talented team, ensuring the delivery of high-quality projects in a collaborative and motivating environment. I am also working as a Software Developer at Trivvo. In this role, I work on both front-end development using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, and back-end development using Kotlin and Spring Boot.

- I am driven by a desire to grow both professionally and personally in the field of computing, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.
