<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lucas Janot</h1>
<h3 align="center">Passionate about technology in UberlÃ¢ndia-MG</h3>

- I am a passionate and dedicated computer science major, in the 5th semester of my degree, with a strong focus on back-end development and information security. Currently, I am honing my skills at the Junior Enterprise of the Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia (UFU) where I serve as a Project Director. My experience encompasses both back-end and front-end technologies, with a particular emphasis on Python and React.

- My role has allowed me to lead a talented team, ensuring the delivery of high-quality projects in a collaborative and motivating environment. I am also involved in a research project centered on information security, specifically the development of an Intrusion Detection Service (IDS) that leverages artificial intelligence to identify and classify malicious packets. This project has deepened my knowledge in cloud computing, AI techniques, and their practical applications in safeguarding information.

- I am driven by a desire to grow both professionally and personally in the field of computing, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.
